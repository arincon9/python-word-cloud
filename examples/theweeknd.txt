Bathroom stalls for the powder nose (she loves)
High heel shoes with the open toes (she loves)
She's got a good time wrapped in gold (she loves)
For you, for you
All red dress with the devil eyes (she loves)
So obsessed with the camera lights (she loves)
You love her, but you can't deny (she loves)
The truth, the truth
She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
It's a false alarm to me
She's a false alarm
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)

Six inch long, 'bout three inch wide (she loves)
Dolla, dolla bill is her only type (she loves)
You love her but you'll never be (she loves)
The one, the one
Diamonds and the rings are her fantasy (she loves)
She chase hearts with the Hennessy (she loves)
You love her, but you'll never be (she loves)
Enough, enough
She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
She's a false alarm to me
She's a false alarm
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)

False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)

She always leaves the man she loves
But the diamonds are forever
She always seems to be alone
But the diamonds make it better
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)

House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby

Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars
House so empty, need a centerpiece

Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go Lo Mein
You know me, you know man, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me
Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause
You know me, you know me
You know man, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

You ain't know me, yet you know me
Yeah, people always talk about the ones that got away
I just seem to get the ones that always want to stay
I'm just too distracted with the life I'm tryna paint
(Yeah, yeah, uh, oh yeah)
Say, I got all these women too attracted to the fame
Not too many niggas that will end up in the way
Nothing's gonna stop me, I'ma get it either way
(Yeah, yeah, uh, oh yeah)
Why would you wanna take away from this moment?

Everybody here wants you
My love, my love
And I know that you want them too
My love, my love
I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lust, your lust
Every time you close your eyes
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
You told me not to worry 'bout
Those guys, those guys
You told me that you left it all behind
Behind
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lust, your lust
Every time you close your eyes
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
Wipe the...
Lust from your eyes
I see that you're not mine
I can see the lust in your eyes
You can't hide it
You can't be the one
I realize, we're divided
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
